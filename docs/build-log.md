# Build Log

This log tracks meaningful project progress by date.

It should document what changed, why it mattered, and what the next step is. It is not meant to list every tiny code edit.

### Changes
- Created initial project planning documents.
- Defined MVP scope for AI Job Search Copilot.
- Established documentation structure for architecture, schema, roadmap, and decision records.
- Added guidance for AI-assisted development workflow.
- Created and applied the initial Prisma migration against PostgreSQL.
- Updated Prisma 7 datasource configuration so CLI migrations use the direct database URL while app runtime can use the pooled URL.

### Notes
- The MVP will focus on a polished job application tracker before adding AI features.
- AI features will be layered in after the core tracker, auth, database, and notes workflows are stable.
- The initial migration establishes the auth-adjacent tables, job tracking tables, notes, job analysis placeholder, enums, indexes, and cascade relationships.

### Next Step
- Implement authentication as the next smallest product milestone before building user-owned job workflows.
